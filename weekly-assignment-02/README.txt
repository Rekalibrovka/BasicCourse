a) Difference between a class and an object
(in simplified way) A class is the definition of whole set of the things and the way for interacting with them. An object is the particular entity of the set including properties (data).

(more in programming way) A class is an abstract data structure with tools to manipulate with it (interfaces). An object (an object of the class) is the instance of the class.

b) Public interface
The interface accessible by anyone - outside of the class.

c) Private interface
The inface accessible only inside of the class.
